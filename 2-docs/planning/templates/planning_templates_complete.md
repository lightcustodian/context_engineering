## Template Usage Instructions

### For Agents Creating Planning Documents

1. **Read Template**: Load the appropriate template from `2-docs/planning/templates/[template_name].md`
2. **Understand Structure**: Follow the template structure exactly
3. **Replace Placeholders**: Replace all `[placeholder text]` with actual project-specific content
4. **Complete All Sections**: Ensure every section is addressed with relevant content
5. **Create Output**: Save completed document to `2-docs/planning/[document_name].md`

### Template Customization

Projects can customize templates by:
- Modifying templates in `2-docs/planning/templates/` directory
- Adding project-specific sections as needed
- Adapting section emphasis based on project type
- Maintaining consistent structure across all planning documents

These templates ensure consistent, comprehensive planning documentation across all Context Engineering projects while allowing agents to focus on analysis and content creation rather than document structure.
