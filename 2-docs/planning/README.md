# ULTRATHINK Planning Phase

This directory contains the planning artifacts generated during the ULTRATHINK Planning Phase of the Context Engineering system.

## Planning Artifacts

The ULTRATHINK Planning Phase generates six comprehensive planning documents:

1. **project-analysis.md**: Overall project analysis and implementation strategy
2. **market-research.md**: Market research findings and recommendations
3. **technical-research.md**: Technical research on the chosen tech stack
4. **architecture-vision.md**: System architecture and component structure
5. **risk-assessment.md**: Risk identification and mitigation strategies
6. **visual-documentation-plan.md**: Diagram planning and visualization guidelines

## Planning Depth

The depth and breadth of these planning artifacts are determined by the settings in PLANNING.md:

- **Research Level**: NONE, MINIMAL, STANDARD, COMPREHENSIVE
- **Risk Management Level**: NONE, MINIMAL, STANDARD, COMPREHENSIVE
- **Planning Level**: NONE, MINIMAL, STANDARD, COMPREHENSIVE
- **Diagram Level**: NONE, MINIMAL, STANDARD, COMPREHENSIVE

## Web Search Integration

The planning phase uses web search (via MCP servers) to gather information for these artifacts. If web search is not available, it falls back to local knowledge.

## Planning Process

1. **Market & Technical Research**: Industry trends, best practices, tech stack validation
2. **Risk Assessment**: Identification of risks and mitigation strategies
3. **Architecture Vision**: System design, component structure, data flow
4. **Visual Documentation**: Diagram planning and visualization guidelines
5. **Project Analysis**: Synthesis of all research findings

## Usage

These planning artifacts are used throughout the development process:

- **PRP Creation**: Informs the creation of Pattern Recognition Prompts
- **Implementation**: Guides the implementation of features
- **Validation**: Provides criteria for validating the implementation

These documents are automatically generated by the Context Engineering system during project initialization.
