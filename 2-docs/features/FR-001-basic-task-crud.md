## Metadata

- **ID**: FR-001
- **Name**: Basic Task CRUD
- **Status**: planned
- **Created**: 2025-07-17
- **Last Updated**: 2025-07-17
- **Estimated Effort**: MEDIUM
- **Confidence Score**: 0.0

## Dependencies

- **Depends On**: None
- **Required By**: FR-003, FR-006

## User Story

As a user, I want to create, read, update, and delete tasks, so that I can manage my task list effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. User can create a new task with title and description
2. User can view existing tasks in a list
3. User can edit task details
4. User can delete tasks
5. User receives appropriate feedback for all operations

## Validation Gates

1. All CRUD operations work correctly
2. Data validation prevents invalid inputs
3. UI provides appropriate feedback

## Integration Points

1. Task data model used by calendar views
2. Task operations logged for time tracking
3. Task data persisted to storage

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

1. Database schema changes may affect other features
2. Performance issues with large task lists

### Mitigation Strategies

1. Use database migrations for schema changes
2. Implement pagination for large task lists

## Test Strategy

### BDD Scenarios

```gherkin
Feature: Task Management

  Scenario: Successfully create a new task
    Given I am on the task creation page
    When I enter "Complete project documentation" as the title
    And I enter "Finish all documentation for the project" as the description
    And I click the "Create" button
    Then I should see "Task created successfully" message
    And the task "Complete project documentation" should appear in my task list
    
  Scenario: Successfully update a task
    Given I have a task "Buy groceries" in my task list
    When I click on the "Edit" button for that task
    And I change the title to "Buy organic groceries"
    And I click the "Save" button
    Then I should see "Task updated successfully" message
    And the task should appear as "Buy organic groceries" in my task list
    
  Scenario: Successfully delete a task
    Given I have a task "Old task" in my task list
    When I click on the "Delete" button for that task
    And I confirm the deletion
    Then I should see "Task deleted successfully" message
    And the task "Old task" should no longer appear in my task list
```

### Test Groups

- **Happy Path**: create_task_success, read_task_success, update_task_success, delete_task_success
- **Edge Cases**: create_task_boundary_values, update_partial_data, empty_task_list
- **Negative Cases**: create_task_invalid_data, delete_nonexistent_task, update_invalid_data

## Implementation Notes

This feature implements the core CRUD functionality for tasks, which serves as the foundation for many other features. The implementation should focus on creating a robust data model and clean API that other features can build upon.
