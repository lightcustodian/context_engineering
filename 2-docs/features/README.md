# Feature Request Decomposition System

## Overview

The Feature Request Decomposition System is a powerful enhancement to the Context Engineering framework that transforms how complex projects are broken down and implemented. Instead of creating a single monolithic PRP (Project Requirements and Planning) document, the system intelligently decomposes complex projects into multiple, progressive feature requests that build upon each other.

## Key Benefits

- **Systematic Decomposition**: Automatically breaks down complex projects into manageable features
- **Dependency Management**: Tracks and manages dependencies between features
- **Progressive Implementation**: Enables incremental development with clear milestones
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Provides unit, integration, and end-to-end testing frameworks
- **Dual-Level Workflow**: Each feature follows the same Requirements → Design → Tasks methodology as the overall project
- **Integration Validation**: Ensures features work together correctly through comprehensive integration testing

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Your Project Plan

Create a `PLANNING.md` file with your project details:

```markdown
# My Project

## Project Overview
A brief description of what you're building.

## Core Features
- Feature 1: Description
- Feature 2: Description
- Feature 3: Description

## Technical Requirements
- Technology stack
- Architecture preferences
- Constraints and requirements
```

### 2. Initialize and Decompose

```bash
# Initialize the Context Engineering system
/init-context my-project

# Create feature-decomposed PRP
/create-prp my-project --complexity=medium --features=auto
```

### 3. Review Generated Features

```bash
# Check what features were created
/feature-status --summary --dependencies

# Review individual features
ls 2-docs/features/
cat 2-docs/features/FR-001/FR-001.md
```

### 4. Implement Features

```bash
# Implement features in dependency order
/execute-prp --feature=FR-001
/validate --feature=FR-001

# Implement dependent features with auto-dependency resolution
/execute-prp --feature=FR-003 --auto-deps
```

### 5. Validate Integration

```bash
# Run integration tests
/validate --integration

# Check overall progress
/feature-status --summary --progress
```

## System Architecture

The Feature Request Decomposition System enhances the existing Context Engineering 5-command workflow:

```
Enhanced Commands:
/init-context → /create-prp [--features=auto] → /execute-prp [--feature=FR-001] → /validate [--integration] → /help [--features]
```

### Core Components

- **Feature Request Generator**: Analyzes projects and creates feature decompositions
- **Dependency Manager**: Manages feature relationships and execution order
- **Integration Test Manager**: Handles cross-feature testing
- **Feature Lifecycle Manager**: Tracks feature status and progress
- **Dual-Level Workflow Engine**: Manages Requirements → Design → Tasks at both project and feature levels

## Feature Structure

Each feature follows a comprehensive structure:

### Feature Request Document
- **Feature Information**: ID, name, status, confidence, effort
- **User Story**: Clear user-focused description
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable conditions
- **BDD Scenarios**: Given-When-Then scenarios with tags
- **Dependencies**: Features this feature depends on
- **Dependents**: Features that depend on this feature
- **Test Groups**: Happy path, edge case, negative case tests
- **Validation Gates**: Criteria for feature completion
- **Integration Points**: How the feature connects to others
- **Risk Assessment**: Technical and business risks

### Dual-Level Workflow
Each feature has its own Requirements → Design → Tasks workflow:

- **requirements.md**: Feature-specific requirements using EARS format
- **design.md**: Feature architecture and technical decisions
- **tasks.md**: Implementation tasks broken down systematically

## Command Reference

### Feature Creation
```bash
# Create features with automatic decomposition
/create-prp [PROJECT_NAME] --complexity=medium --features=auto

# Create features with manual specification
/create-prp [PROJECT_NAME] --features=manual

# Limit number of features generated
/create-prp [PROJECT_NAME] --max-features=8
```

### Feature Execution
```bash
# Execute all features in dependency order
/execute-prp

# Execute specific feature
/execute-prp --feature=FR-001

# Execute feature with automatic dependency resolution
/execute-prp --feature=FR-003 --auto-deps

# Execute specific phase of a feature
/execute-prp --feature=FR-001 --phase=requirements
```

### Feature Validation
```bash
# Validate specific feature
/validate --feature=FR-001

# Validate multiple features
/validate --feature=FR-001,FR-002,FR-003

# Validate with dependencies
/validate --feature=FR-003 --deep

# Run integration tests
/validate --integration

# Comprehensive validation
/validate --deep --integration --level=comprehensive
```

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Start Small**: Begin with foundational features and build complexity gradually
2. **Clear Dependencies**: Explicitly define and document feature relationships
3. **Validate Early**: Test features individually and through integration as soon as they're implemented
4. **Track Progress**: Monitor feature completion and overall project progress regularly
5. **Use Integration Testing**: Ensure features work together correctly through comprehensive testing
6. **Follow Workflow**: Complete Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation for each feature
7. **Manage Dependencies**: Use `--auto-deps` for automatic dependency resolution

### Documentation Resources
- Start with the [Quick Reference](QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for immediate needs
- Read the [Workflow Guide](WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md) for comprehensive workflow understanding
- Check [Best Practices](BEST_PRACTICES.md) for recommended approaches
- Use [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) when encountering issues

### Common Issues
- **No features generated**: Check PLANNING.md detail and increase complexity level
- **Circular dependencies**: Use dependency analysis and restructure relationships
- **Integration test failures**: Validate individual features first, then debug integration points
- **Performance issues**: Use isolated validation and optimize feature complexity

## Contributing

The Feature Request Decomposition System is part of the Context Engineering Parent Project. Enhancements and improvements should follow the established Context Engineering development patterns and maintain backward compatibility with existing workflows.

## Conclusion

The Feature Request Decomposition System transforms complex project development into a systematic, manageable process. By breaking projects into well-defined features with clear dependencies and comprehensive testing, it enables teams to build high-quality software with confidence and clarity.

Whether you're working on a simple application with a few features or a complex system with dozens of interdependent components, the Feature Request Decomposition System provides the structure and tools needed for successful development.
