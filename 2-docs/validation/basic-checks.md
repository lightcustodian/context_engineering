# Basic Validation Checks for [PROJECT_NAME]

**Purpose**: Standard validation procedures for [TECH_STACK] projects
**Function**: Defines quality gates and testing requirements

## Validation Levels

### Level 1: Syntax & Style
```bash
# Syntax validation
[SYNTAX_CHECK_COMMAND]

# Code formatting
[FORMATTING_COMMAND]

# Linting
[LINTING_COMMAND]
```

### Level 2: Unit Tests
```bash
# Unit test execution
[UNIT_TEST_COMMAND]

# Test coverage check
# Coverage threshold: 80% minimum
```

### Level 3: Integration Tests
```bash
# Integration test execution
[INTEGRATION_TEST_COMMAND]

# End-to-end testing
# API endpoint testing
```

### Level 4: Quality Gates
```bash
# Type checking (if applicable)
[TYPE_CHECK_COMMAND]

# Security scanning
# Performance benchmarking
# Documentation completeness
```

## TDD Validation

### Test Group Validation
- Happy path tests: All core functionality tests pass
- Edge case tests: Boundary condition tests pass  
- Negative case tests: Error handling tests pass

## Auto-Fix Capabilities
- Syntax errors: Basic syntax fixes
- Formatting issues: Code style corrections
- Import organization: Import statement cleanup
- Simple linting issues: Basic code quality fixes
