# Test Strategy Template

## Testing Levels Overview

### Task-Level Testing (Granular)
- **Scope**: Individual functions and methods
- **Coverage**: 100% of task-specific code
- **Speed**: Fast execution (< 1 second per test)
- **Focus**: Unit functionality, edge cases, error conditions

### Feature-Level Testing (Comprehensive)
- **Scope**: Complete feature functionality
- **Coverage**: All feature user stories and acceptance criteria
- **Speed**: Moderate execution (< 30 seconds per feature)
- **Focus**: Feature integration, user workflows, business logic

### Project-Level Testing (Exhaustive)
- **Scope**: Full system integration and user journeys
- **Coverage**: All critical user paths and system interactions
- **Speed**: Slower execution (< 5 minutes for full suite)
- **Focus**: End-to-end workflows, performance, security

## 1. Test Coverage Alignment

### Task-Level Coverage
```markdown
For each task in the task list:
- [ ] Happy path test exists
- [ ] Edge case tests cover boundary conditions
- [ ] Error handling tests cover failure scenarios
- [ ] Mock tests for external dependencies
```

### Feature-Level Coverage
```markdown
For each feature user story:
- [ ] Acceptance criteria tests exist
- [ ] Integration tests with dependent features
- [ ] User interface tests (if applicable)
- [ ] Data validation and business rule tests
```

### Project-Level Coverage
```markdown
For each critical user journey:
- [ ] End-to-end workflow tests
- [ ] Cross-feature integration tests
- [ ] Performance and load tests
- [ ] Security and access control tests
```

## 2. Red-Green-Refactor Flow

### Implementation Sequence
1. **Red Phase**: Write failing tests first
   - Task-level: Write unit test, verify it fails
   - Feature-level: Write integration test, verify it fails
   - Project-level: Write E2E test, verify it fails

2. **Green Phase**: Implement minimum code to pass
   - Task-level: Implement function to pass unit test
   - Feature-level: Implement feature to pass integration test
   - Project-level: Complete system to pass E2E test

3. **Refactor Phase**: Improve code quality
   - Task-level: Optimize function implementation
   - Feature-level: Improve feature architecture
   - Project-level: Optimize system performance

### Validation Checkpoints
```markdown
After each phase:
- [ ] All tests at current level pass
- [ ] No regression in higher-level tests
- [ ] Code quality metrics maintained
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

## 3. Integration Test Compatibility

### Feature Integration Guidelines
- **Loose Coupling**: Features communicate through well-defined interfaces
- **Event-Driven**: Use events/messages rather than direct calls where possible
- **Idempotent Operations**: Operations can be safely retried
- **Graceful Degradation**: Features work with reduced functionality when dependencies fail

### Integration Test Types
```markdown
Feature-to-Feature Tests:
- [ ] Data exchange between features
- [ ] Event handling and propagation
- [ ] Shared resource access
- [ ] Error handling across features

System Integration Tests:
- [ ] Database connectivity and transactions
- [ ] External API interactions
- [ ] File system operations
- [ ] Configuration loading and validation
```

## 4. Test Data Consistency

### Test Data Management
- **Isolated Data**: Each test uses independent data sets
- **Reproducible**: Same test data produces same results
- **Realistic**: Test data mirrors production scenarios
- **Minimal**: Only essential data for test scenarios

### Data Patterns
```markdown
Task-Level Data:
- Simple, focused data for individual functions
- Fixed inputs with known expected outputs
- Edge case data (empty, null, extreme values)

Feature-Level Data:
- Complete business entities and relationships
- Workflow-based data scenarios
- User role and permission variations

Project-Level Data:
- Full user journey data sets
- Cross-feature data dependencies
- Performance testing data volumes
```

## 5. Test Isolation

### Isolation Principles
- **No Shared State**: Tests don't depend on other tests
- **Clean Setup/Teardown**: Each test starts with known state
- **Independent Execution**: Tests can run in any order
- **Resource Management**: Tests clean up after themselves

### Isolation Strategies
```markdown
Database Isolation:
- [ ] Use test database or in-memory database
- [ ] Transaction rollback after each test
- [ ] Database seeding for consistent state

File System Isolation:
- [ ] Temporary directories for test files
- [ ] File cleanup after test completion
- [ ] No shared file dependencies

External Service Isolation:
- [ ] Mock external APIs and services
- [ ] Stub network calls
- [ ] Simulate various response scenarios
```

## 6. Additional Test Strategy Components

### Test Environment Management
- **Local Development**: Fast feedback for developers
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing on code changes
- **Staging Environment**: Production-like testing environment
- **Production Monitoring**: Real-time system health checks

### Test Automation Pipeline
```markdown
Pre-commit Hooks:
- [ ] Run task-level tests
- [ ] Code quality checks
- [ ] Fast feedback (< 30 seconds)

Build Pipeline:
- [ ] Full feature-level test suite
- [ ] Integration test execution
- [ ] Security vulnerability scanning

Deployment Pipeline:
- [ ] Project-level test execution
- [ ] Performance benchmark testing
- [ ] Production smoke tests
```

### Test Metrics and Reporting
- **Coverage Metrics**: Line, branch, and function coverage
- **Performance Metrics**: Test execution time, system resource usage
- **Quality Metrics**: Test failure rates, flaky test identification
- **Trend Analysis**: Coverage and quality trends over time

## 7. Dependency Management Guidelines (Non-Programmatic)

### Design Guidelines for Dependencies
- **Feature Independence**: Each feature should be developable in isolation
- **Interface Contracts**: Clear, documented interfaces between features
- **Dependency Direction**: Dependencies should flow toward stable, foundational features
- **Loose Coupling**: Minimize direct dependencies through events/messaging

### Testing Dependency Strategy
```markdown
Development Sequence:
1. Build foundation features first (user management, core data models)
2. Build dependent features with mocked dependencies
3. Integration testing validates real dependencies
4. Project-level testing validates complete dependency chain

Dependency Testing Approach:
- [ ] Mock dependencies during feature development
- [ ] Test actual dependencies during integration
- [ ] Validate dependency failures don't cascade
- [ ] Document dependency relationships clearly

## Non-Software Project Testing Adaptations
### Marketing Projects
- Task Testing: Content quality checklists, brand compliance validation
- Feature Testing: Campaign component reviews, audience targeting validation  
- Project Testing: Full campaign effectiveness assessment

### Research Projects  
- Task Testing: Data validation, methodology compliance
- Feature Testing: Analysis component reviews, finding validation
- Project Testing: Research conclusions and recommendations validation
```

## 8. Additional Testing Framework Improvements
