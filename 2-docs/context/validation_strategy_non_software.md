# Validation Strategy Template: Non-Software Projects

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidance for adapting the Context Engineering validation framework to non-software projects. The systematic approach maintains the same rigor and quality gates while using appropriate validation methods for different project types.

## Core Adaptation Principles

### Validation Equivalency
- **Task Validation**: Individual deliverable quality assessment
- **Feature Validation**: Component integration and stakeholder review
- **Project Validation**: Complete project acceptance and success criteria

### Agent Role Adaptations
- **Code Testing Agent** → **Validation Agent**: Performs systematic validation of all deliverable types
- **Test Writer Agent** → **Validation Designer Agent**: Creates comprehensive validation approaches
- **Stakeholder Agent**: NEW - Performs stakeholder review processes for non-code deliverables

### Automation Maintenance
All validation remains automated through agent execution - no human intervention required during validation processes.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Validation Sequence
1. **Task-Level**: Individual deliverable quality validation
2. **Feature-Level**: Component integration and stakeholder review
3. **Project-Level**: Complete project acceptance validation

### Quality Gates
- Each validation level must pass before proceeding
- Validation failures trigger remediation processes
- All validation results documented for audit trail
- Success criteria validated at each level

### Automation Maintenance
- All validation processes remain fully automated
- Agents perform all validation activities
- No human intervention required during validation
- Results presented to users only for approval gates

### Continuous Improvement
- Validation procedures refined based on project outcomes
- New validation patterns captured for reuse
- Agent performance optimized through validation feedback
- Quality standards evolved through project learning

This adaptation framework ensures that non-software projects receive the same systematic validation rigor as software projects while using appropriate validation methods for each deliverable type.
