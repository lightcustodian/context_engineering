# Unit Tests Directory

This directory contains unit tests organized by test groups and features.

## Structure

Unit tests will be organized by feature:
```
unit/
├── FR-001-feature-name/
│   ├── happy-path.test.[ext]
│   ├── edge-case.test.[ext]
│   └── negative-case.test.[ext]
└── FR-002-another-feature/
    ├── happy-path.test.[ext]
    ├── edge-case.test.[ext]
    └── negative-case.test.[ext]
```

## Test Groups

### Happy Path Tests
- Test core functionality with valid inputs
- Verify main use cases work correctly
- Focus on expected user behavior

### Edge Case Tests  
- Test boundary conditions
- Handle unusual but valid inputs
- Verify system behavior at limits

### Negative Case Tests
- Test error handling
- Verify invalid input handling
- Ensure graceful failure modes

## Generated by Context Engineering

These tests are automatically generated by the Context Engineering system based on:
- Feature specifications from `/create-prp`
- Technology stack configuration
- Project requirements and design

The test framework and syntax will match your project's technology stack.
