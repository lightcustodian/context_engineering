# End-to-End Tests Directory

This directory contains end-to-end tests that verify complete user workflows and system functionality.

## Structure

E2E tests will be organized by user workflows:
```
e2e/
├── user-workflows/
│   ├── complete-user-journey.test.[ext]
│   ├── admin-workflow.test.[ext]
│   └── guest-workflow.test.[ext]
├── system-workflows/
│   ├── data-processing-pipeline.test.[ext]
│   └── system-integration.test.[ext]
└── performance/
    ├── load-testing.test.[ext]
    └── stress-testing.test.[ext]
```

## Test Types

### User Workflow Tests
- Test complete user journeys from start to finish
- Verify user interface interactions
- Test user authentication and authorization flows

### System Workflow Tests
- Test automated system processes
- Verify data processing pipelines
- Test system-to-system integrations

### Performance Tests
- Test system performance under normal load
- Verify system behavior under stress
- Test scalability and resource usage

## Technology Stack Integration

E2E tests will use appropriate tools based on your project's technology stack:
- **Web Applications**: Playwright, Cypress, or Selenium
- **API Services**: REST/GraphQL API testing tools
- **Mobile Apps**: Appium or platform-specific tools
- **Desktop Apps**: Platform-specific automation tools

## Generated by Context Engineering

These tests are automatically generated by the Context Engineering system based on:
- Complete user journeys from project requirements
- System architecture and integration points
- Performance requirements from PLANNING.md
- Technology stack configuration

The Code Test Writer Agent creates these tests during `/execute-prp` execution for comprehensive coverage.
