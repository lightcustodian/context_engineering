# Feature Interaction Tests

This directory contains integration tests that validate how features work together. These tests ensure that when multiple features are implemented, they interact correctly and don't interfere with each other.

## Test Organization

### Feature Interaction Tests
- Test cross-feature functionality
- Validate data flow between features
- Ensure consistent behavior across feature boundaries
- Verify feature dependencies work correctly

### Test Naming Convention
- `{feature1-id}-{feature2-id}-interaction.test.js` - Tests interaction between two specific features
- `{feature-group}-interaction.test.js` - Tests interaction within a group of related features
- `multi-feature-{scenario}.test.js` - Tests complex scenarios involving multiple features

### Test Tags
Use the following tags to categorize integration tests:
- `@integration` - Marks test as integration test
- `@features:FR-001,FR-002` - Specifies which features are involved
- `@critical` - Marks critical integration paths
- `@data-flow` - Tests data flow between features
- `@state-management` - Tests state consistency across features

## Example Test Structure

```javascript
// FR-001-FR-002-interaction.test.js
// @features:FR-001,FR-002
// @integration

describe('Basic Task CRUD and Task Hierarchy Integration', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup test environment
  });

  test('should create hierarchical tasks correctly', async () => {
    // Test that task hierarchy works with basic CRUD operations
  });

  test('should maintain data consistency across features', async () => {
    // Test data flow between features
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    // Cleanup test environment
  });
});
```

## Running Integration Tests

```bash
# Run all integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run specific feature interaction tests
npm run test:integration -- --grep "FR-001.*FR-002"

# Run tests with specific tags
npm run test:integration -- --grep "@critical"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Test Real Interactions**: Focus on actual feature interactions, not implementation details
2. **Use Realistic Data**: Use data that represents real user scenarios
3. **Test Error Conditions**: Verify error handling across feature boundaries
4. **Maintain Independence**: Each test should be independent and not rely on other tests
5. **Clear Assertions**: Make assertions specific and meaningful
6. **Document Dependencies**: Clearly document which features are being tested together

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Test Isolation**: Ensure tests don't interfere with each other
- **Data Setup**: Make sure test data is properly initialized
- **Async Operations**: Handle asynchronous operations correctly
- **State Cleanup**: Clean up state between tests

### Debugging Tips
- Use descriptive test names that explain what interaction is being tested
- Add logging to understand the flow of data between features
- Use debugging tools to step through feature interactions
- Verify that all required features are properly initialized before testing
