# Integration Tests Directory

This directory contains integration tests that verify feature interactions and system-level functionality.

## Structure

Integration tests will be organized by feature interactions:
```
integration/
├── feature-interactions/
│   ├── FR-001-FR-002-interaction.test.[ext]
│   └── FR-002-FR-003-interaction.test.[ext]
├── data-flow/
│   ├── user-data-flow.test.[ext]
│   └── system-data-flow.test.[ext]
└── system-level/
    ├── end-to-end-workflows.test.[ext]
    └── performance-integration.test.[ext]
```

## Test Types

### Feature Interaction Tests
- Test how features work together
- Verify data flow between features
- Ensure feature dependencies work correctly

### Data Flow Tests
- Test data consistency across features
- Verify state management
- Test data persistence and retrieval

### System-Level Tests
- Test complete user workflows
- Verify system performance under load
- Test system configuration and setup

## Generated by Context Engineering

These tests are automatically generated by the Context Engineering system based on:
- Feature dependencies from the feature registry
- Cross-feature requirements
- System architecture and data flow
- Integration points identified during design

The Code Integration Tester Agent creates these tests during `/execute-prp` execution.
