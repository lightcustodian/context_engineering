# Test Directory Structure

This directory contains the test framework for the project, organized according to TDD/BDD principles.

## Directory Structure

- **unit/**: Unit tests organized by test groups
  - Happy path tests (core functionality)
  - Edge case tests (boundary conditions)
  - Negative case tests (error handling)

- **bdd/**: Behavior-Driven Development tests
  - **features/**: Gherkin feature files
  - **step_definitions/**: Step definition implementations

- **mapping/**: BDD-Unit test traceability mapping
  - JSON files linking BDD scenarios to unit tests

- **config/**: Test framework configuration
  - Framework-specific configuration files
  - BDD integration configuration

- **fixtures/**: Test data and fixtures

## Test Organization

Tests are organized into three main groups:

1. **Happy Path Tests**: Core functionality tests that verify the main use cases work correctly
2. **Edge Case Tests**: Tests that verify boundary conditions and unusual inputs
3. **Negative Case Tests**: Tests that verify error handling and invalid inputs

## BDD-Unit Test Traceability

BDD scenarios are linked to unit tests using tags and mapping files:

```gherkin
@happy_path @unit-test-group:happy
Scenario: Successfully add a new item
  Given I have valid input data
  When I add a new item
  Then the item should be added successfully
```

The mapping files in `tests/mapping/` link these scenarios to specific unit tests.

## Running Tests

- **All Tests**: `npm test`
- **Unit Tests**: `npm run test:unit`
- **BDD Tests**: `npm run test:bdd`
- **Test Coverage**: `npm run test:coverage`

## Test-Driven Development Workflow

1. Write a failing test (Red)
2. Implement the minimum code to make the test pass (Green)
3. Refactor the code while keeping tests passing (Refactor)
4. Repeat for each test group (Happy → Edge → Negative)

This test structure is automatically generated by the Context Engineering system during project initialization.
