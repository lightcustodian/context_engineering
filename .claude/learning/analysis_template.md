- **Fallback Effectiveness**: Performance when MCP servers unavailable
- **Learning Quality**: Depth and actionability of insights generated
- **Cross-Project Applicability**: Generalizability of discovered patterns

## Aggregation Guidelines
When combining multiple project analyses:
1. **CRP Pattern Recognition**: Identify context management strategies that work consistently
2. **Critical Review Effectiveness**: Determine most successful overconfidence intervention patterns
3. **Context Budget Optimization**: Recognize optimal 20K budget utilization strategies
4. **Exception Handling Patterns**: Identify most effective large document processing approaches
5. **Quality Correlation**: Link CRP implementation quality to project success outcomes

## Framework Enhancement Process
1. **Individual Analysis**: Each project generates comprehensive learning analysis
2. **Cross-Project Aggregation**: Combine analyses to identify reliable CRP patterns
3. **Framework Integration**: Incorporate proven patterns into orchestration instructions
4. **CRP System Refinement**: Enhance context management and critical review capabilities
5. **Continuous Validation**: Test enhanced framework with new projects and measure improvement
