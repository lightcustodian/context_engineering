## Context Engineering System Instructions

You are working within a **Context Engineering system** that provides systematic, high-quality development workflows. This is a **child project** that uses the Context Engineering framework for structured development.

### Core Principles
- **Structure Over Intuition**: Follow systematic processes rather than ad-hoc decisions
- **Quality Gates**: Maintain quality at every stage through validation
- **Specialized Roles**: Use appropriate agent specialization for different tasks
- **Documentation-Driven**: Create comprehensive documentation throughout
- **Test-First Approach**: Implement TDD methodology for all code components

## Multi-Agent Orchestration System

### Enhanced Orchestration Pattern
All commands use the **Orchestration Agent → Specialist Agent → Orchestration Agent** pattern with intelligent external capability access:

1. **Command Initiation**: Each .claude command initiates an Orchestration Agent
2. **Capability Planning**: Orchestration Agent analyzes all planned work and identifies required external capabilities
3. **External Tool Access**: MCP Agent provides necessary external capabilities transparently
4. **Specialist Assignment**: Orchestration Agent determines which specialist agents are needed based on project type, complexity, and requirements
5. **Task Delegation**: Orchestration Agent assigns specific tasks to appropriate specialist agents with clear context and expected outputs
6. **Specialist Execution**: Specialist agents perform domain-specific work using available tools and report results back to the Orchestration Agent
7. **Integration and Synthesis**: Orchestration Agent combines specialist outputs into cohesive project deliverables
8. **Quality Control**: Orchestration Agent ensures all specialist work integrates properly and meets quality standards

### Agent Assignment Rules
Agent assignment is determined by:
- **Project Type**: Software, marketing, research, design, mixed
- **Complexity Level**: Simple, medium, complex
- **Planning Depth**: Minimal, standard, comprehensive
- **Capability Requirements**: External tools and services needed

Configuration stored in: `.claude/settings.json`

### Agent Delegation Pattern
```markdown
# Standard delegation pattern in commands:

## Step X: Load Orchestration Agent
Load agent persona: @../agents/core_orchestrator.md

## Step Y: Capability Analysis and MCP Coordination
Orchestration Agent analyzes all planned work and requests capabilities:
"Need capabilities: file_operations, version_control, web_search, testing_framework"

MCP Agent coordination: @../agents/core_mcp.md
Returns: "Development environment ready: filesystem, git, brave-search, jest connected."

## Step Z: Determine Required Specialists
Based on project configuration and available capabilities, assign:
- Required agents per project type and complexity
- Specialist agents for domain-specific tasks

## Step AA: Delegate to Specialist Agents
For each required specialist:
Create subagent with persona: @../agents/[agent_name].md

Your specific task: [CLEAR_TASK_DESCRIPTION]
Your input context: [RELEVANT_PROJECT_INFO]
Your expected output: [SPECIFIC_DELIVERABLE]
Available tools: [TOOLS_FROM_MCP_AGENT]
```

### Template System
All planning documents use templates from: `2-docs/planning/templates/`
- **Templates**: Define structure and required sections
- **Agents**: Focus on analysis and content creation using templates
- **Output**: Consistent document structure across all projects

## Intelligent External Capability Access

### MCP Agent Integration
The **MCP Agent** (`core_mcp.md`) manages all external tool access through capability-based requests:

- **Collaboration**: Team communication and project management

#### Efficient Request Pattern
```
Orchestration Agent: "Need capabilities: file_operations, version_control, testing_framework"
MCP Agent: "Development environment ready: filesystem, git, jest connected. 18 tools available."
Specialists: Work with tools transparently throughout execution
```
